# JDE's system configurations

This repository contains the Nix code required to configure the different machines under JDE's control.

## Mournblade

Work X13G4, running NixOS. Nothing here yet as the config is full of secrets.

## Excalibur

Work MacBook, running a horribly unusable OS.

## Code structure

- The flake serves as an entrypoint to call the proper files for the host.
- Each host has a system configuration file which contains OS-wide configuration (KISS)
- Each host has a home-manager file which contains my user's configuration: this should
  be kept as minimal as possible and use shared reusable modules.
- `programs/` contains configurations for a specific program.
- `scripts/` contains shell scripts and their default.nix file.
